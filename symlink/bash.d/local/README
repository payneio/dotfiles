# The local Directory

This directory contains two subdirectories, `before` and `after`, that are
intended bash configuration files that are specific for the local machine.

All the files within these directories are sourced by bash upon start up in
this order:

 * The files in the *before* subdirectory
 * The files directly under the parent directory (`.bash.d`)
 * The files in the *after* subdirectory

New files in these subdirectories are not tracked by git.

These specific configuration files can be used for configurations that depend
on a particular piece of hardware being available, or to have a different shell
prompt for different machines, etc.
